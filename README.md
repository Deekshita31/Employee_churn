# Employee_churn
**Employee Churn Analysis Project**
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee churn within a company, commonly known as employee turnover. Employee churn is a critical metric for organizations as it reflects the rate at which employees leave the company. By understanding the contributing factors to employee churn, businesses can implement targeted strategies to enhance employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to identify key factors influencing employee churn and to develop predictive models that can forecast which employees are likely to leave the company. By leveraging these insights, the organization can proactively implement measures to mitigate churn and enhance overall employee retention.

DataSet
The dataset used in this project comprises approximately 15,000 rows, with the following attributes:

satisfaction_level: Employee satisfaction level, ranging from 0 to 1.
last_evaluation: Score of the employee's last performance evaluation.
number_project: Number of projects the employee is involved in.
average_monthly_hours: Average monthly hours worked by the employee.
time_spend_company: Number of years the employee has spent at the company.
Work_accident: Binary indicator (0 or 1) of whether the employee has had a work accident.
left: Binary target variable indicating whether the employee left the company (1) or not (0).
promotion_last_5years: Binary indicator of whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years.
departments: To which department does the employee belongs to.
salary: The amount of salary the employee gets.

Usage
Data Exploration:

Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of variables.
Identify any trends or patterns related to employee churn.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the relationships between different attributes and employee churn.
Identify potential factors contributing to employee turnover.
Model Building:

Utilize machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
Interpretation:

Interpret the model results to identify the most significant factors influencing employee churn.
Recommendations:

Provide recommendations for the organization based on the analysis to improve employee retention.
